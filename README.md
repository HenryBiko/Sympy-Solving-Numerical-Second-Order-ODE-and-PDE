# Sympy-Solving-Numerical-Second-Order-ODE-and-PDE
In this project we solve oscillatory harmonic equations using sympy and Scipy pythonh packages
We also process sound into a wave and analyze the dominant frequencies. It is through this that we can make future noise cancelling earbuds as we will have target frequencies that we would like to be cancelled
